# README

This repository accompanies the book *Functional Programming in Java*.

It is not a library nor a framework.
It is a collection of constrained experiments, designed to expose the structure of functional programming by implementing it inside Java.

The code exists to support the text.
The text exists to explain the design pressure the code reveals.

## Repository Structure

- `doc/`  
  Contains the book itself, written in Markdown, chapter by chapter.

- `app/src/`  
  Contains the accompanying Java source code used throughout the book.
  The code is intentionally minimal and illustrative rather than production-ready.
